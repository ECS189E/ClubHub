# ClubHub
Our iOS application, ClubHub, is an all-in-one interface for UC Davis students to receive updates on the various Computer Science clubs on campus. ClubHub provides users an opportunity to learn club objectives, follow clubs, and to discover and save club events. With the growing number of clubs on campus, students need a single platform to be able to find clubs and events. Clubs on campus need a way to promote their objectives and events as well as communicate with members.

## Magical Moment
Currently, there is not a single platform for students to discover and get event information about the existing clubs on campus. UC Davis provides a list of organizations on their website, however, the information is limited and leaves students confused about how to get involved. CS students use the Computer Science Club's facebook page to learn about events and meetings, however, events get easily lost in the feeds and smaller clubs get little representation. To stay up to date on clubs of interest, students must follow and frequently check multiple pages and websites and must manage events they want to attend themselves. This can be time-consuming and may discourage students from getting involved. Our app solves this problem.

## Clean Navigation Flow
The goal of this app was to make getting involved easier, so making the signup process and navigation flow of the app straightforward was a primary goal. Providing a simple signup and login flow allows students to quickly get to the information they want. The consistent and organized tab controller flow make finding and saving relevant information easy and encourages students to take advantage of the resources available to them.
